# testproject

Why does the ``testsproject`` even exist?

* It's a real Django mini application built on top of ``django-firestone``.
  It's controlled by the ``bin/manage`` script, and can be used from anyone to
  get to know the framework
* More importantly, it's showcasing some of the building blocks of the
  framework and how real applications can be built on top of it   
* Most importantly, it's used as a boat for unit-testing the framework. The
  tests are in the ``tests`` folder.
